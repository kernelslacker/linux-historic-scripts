Linux 2.2.19
  
   Platforms:Alpha, M68K, PowerPC, S/390, Sparc, X86
   
   Introduction
   Linux 2.2.19 is the latest update to the Linux kernel tree. The out of
   the box tree supports the Alpha, PPC, S/390, Sparc and X86 platforms.
   MIPS and ARM are mostly merged but you should obtain the platform
   specific tree.
   
   Compilers
   This code is intended to build with gcc 2.7.2 and egcs 1.1.2. gcc
   2.95.2 and Red Hat gcc 2.96-79 are believed to build the tree
   correctly. As yet we have no detailed information on gcc 2.95.3 but it
   seems to build the tree correctly.
   
   Binary Compatibility
   Linux 2.2.19 should on the whole be fully binary compatible with old
   modules. In general you should not assume binary compatibility between
   kernel object modules in Linux.
   
   Security Notes
   
   Linux 2.2.19 contains significant security fixes as a result of third
   party testing and auditing. We are very grateful to those who
   contributed work and reports to this effort, in particular to OpenWall
   and to Chris Evans.

   Security Updates
   
   binfmt_misc
          binfmt_misc touched user pages directly and could be exploited.
          
   CPIA driver
          An off by one buffer check in the CPIA driver allowed users to
          scribble into kernel memory
          
   CPUID and MSR drivers
          Unloading and reloading these could cause a crash due to
          missing unregister calls. Normally not exploitable but if set
          to autoload and unload they could be abused.
          
   Classifier
          Fix a possible hang in the classifier code.
          
   get/setsockopt
          Mishandling of sign bits in setsockopt and getsockopt allowed
          local DoS and other attacks.
          
   Ptrace/exec race
          Ptrace and exec as well as ptrace/suid races existed that could
          give a local user privileges.
          
   Sockfilter
          Boundary cases in sockfilter could be abused. It is not clear
          if these are actually exploitable
          
   strnlen_user
          Several problems with the implementation have been cured.
          
   SYS5 shared memory
          A code path existed where the shm code would scribble on very
          recently freed memory. It is not clear that this was actually
          exploitable.
          
   sysctl
          Mishandling of sign bits in sysctl allowed local users to
          scribble on kernel memory.
          
   Tighten packet length checks
          The masquerading code checks were a little lax in some cases.
          None of these are believed actually exploitable however.
          
   User access asm bug on x86
          Certain obscure constant copies came out copying the wrong
          number of bytes. No known exploit or actual problem case is
          known but it potentially existed.
          
   UDP Deadlock
          A local user could deadlock the kernel due to bugs in UDP port
          allocation.
          
   Core Updates
   
   Core Dump
          Write out core dumps as sparse files
          
   Dcache aging
          Do aging on the dcache to improve behaviour under load
          
   Hash functions
          Improve the inode and dcache hash functions
          
   Misc device layer
          Reuse of the same minor number is now errored
          
   Page cache coherency
          A problem existed on machines with ambiguous user/kernel
          addresses (the S/390) that could cause the page and buffer
          cache to lose coherency
          
   Page fault
          Ensure a task always handles page faults in run state
          
   Signal delivery
          Queued I/O completion delivery from interrupt context was
          unreliable
          
   Virtual memory
          Revamp the core VM handling to remove a long standing deadlock.
