Linux 2.2.22

Linux 2.2.22 is primarily an errata release backporting fixes for multiple
small kernel errors found during auditing of the 2.4 code. 2.2 based users who
have untrusted local users should update to this kernel.

In addition the kernel fixes some bugs in the HDLC layer and adds support
for the newest 3ware IDE RAID cards.
