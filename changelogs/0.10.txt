Linux 0.10 (November 11, 1991 ???)

Likely correct 0.10: these were re-created from the RCS tree that Ted
Ts'o had, no known pristine 0.10 tree (or, sadly, 0.02 and 0.03 trees)
exist any more. 

Linux-0.10 was actually a major step.  It was _almost_ able to host
itself, and if I remember correctly, a small patch I posted to the
newsgroup a few days later got the buffer cache handling stable enough
that Linux could now compile itself under itself without running out of
memory due to a memory leak. 

Apart from bugfixes, the major update here is the support for
mount/umount.  But you can also tell that others are starting to test
out this thing, since the harddisk geometry is now auto-sensed, and we
support the US keyboard layout in addition to the Finnish one. 

(This is also the first actual thing from the outside: the US keyboard
layout tables came from Alfred Leung, although with major editing by me.)

 - add copyright messages ("(C) 1991  Linus Torvalds")

   Nobody else is really doing coding (yet..) but clearly I'm starting
   to be a lot more aware of other people here.

 - split up boot/boot.s into boot/bootsect.s and boot/setup.s
 - autodetect floppy type for booting
 - make root device and boot device configurable

 - support up to 16MB of physical memory (instead of just 8MB ;)

   Whee. We're clearly moving into the "big iron" phase of Linux.

 - move drivers around.  We now have separate subdirectories for
   character device drivers (tty and memory) and block device drivers. 

 - initial floppy driver support!

   You can see how the "block layer" interfaces evolved directly from
   moving parts of the original hd.c driver into ll_rw_block.c and
   making them "generic". 

 - make file reading do simple read-ahead
 - make file writing avoid reading in blocks that are totally overwritten
 - add support for /dev/port and /dev/null (!!)
 - improve pipe throughput

 - add support for sigaction(), not just old-style signal()

   This also rewrites most of the signal code in C rather than assembly.

 - add "mknod()" and "mount()"/"umount()" system calls, and support
   for traversing over mount-points.

 - add "sessions" and setsid(), so that we get proper SIGHUP's
